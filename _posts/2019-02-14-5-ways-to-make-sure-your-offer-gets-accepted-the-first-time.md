Do you ever wonder why your offers never get accepted? Here’s a list of the top five ways to get your offer accepted the first time:

**1. Make sure your purchase price is reasonable.** Do your homework by running comps in the area before submitting an offer.

**2. Don’t ask for any concessions**. Or, if you do ask, make sure they’re reasonable.

**3. Put a large deposit down to show the seller that you’re serious.**

**4. Make an all cash offer.** Remember, cash is king—don’t forget that.

**5. Shorten the close of escrow and inspection periods.**
