Today I’m joined again by my main man Kevin to answer an important question: How do you present an offer to the listing agent so it has the best chance of getting accepted?

**There are eight steps to follow:**

1\. Contact the listing agent and let them know you’ll be showing the property and ask if there are any offers or there’s anything else they can share.&nbsp;

2\. Communicate any information from the listing agent to your buyer and lender.

3\. Have the buyer’s lender create desktop underwriter approval.

4\. Consider shortening your contingency terms.

5\. Consider increasing the earnest money deposit.&nbsp;

6\. Have your buyer write a letter to the seller about their story and why the house is so important to them.

7\. Outline the terms of the offer in an email and attach the following documents: the residential purchase agreement, approval letter, proof of funds, and the buyer’s letter to the seller.

8\. Follow up with the listing agent after you send the offer.&nbsp;

**In a best-case scenario, you don’t want a bunch of counteroffers—you want that first offer accepted.** Communication with the listing agent is key, and the guidelines we’ve provided should help this process. Doing just a few simple things in the beginning could get your offer accepted the first time.&nbsp;
