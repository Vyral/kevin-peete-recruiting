Did you know that top-producing buyer’s and seller’s agents not only know their purpose to their clients, but are also able to articulate it when asked?

My main man Kevin (my son) says this about his purpose to his clients:&nbsp;

“My purpose to sellers is to always make them the most money possible in the shortest amount of time with the fewest number of problems. My purpose to buyers is to find them the right home in a nice neighborhood at the best price in the shortest amount of time, and with as few problems as possible.”

If you want to learn more about RE/MAX Patriots’ purpose and how they can benefit you as a homebuyer or seller, feel free to reach out to me. We’d be glad to help you.
