How do you succeed in our changing market in 2019? There are four elements that you need to control:

**1. Your reputation.** Your reputation, obviously, is very important, so you need to control it the right way—not only through outlets like online reviews, but also in terms how your past clients think of you in your community.

<br>**2. Your relationships.** Are you building strategic or vertical relationships with the vendors you work with? What about the relationships in your community? Do you attend any social events or involve yourself in any networking clubs?

<br>**3. Prospects.** This means how you get new leads, how you convert those leads, and how you handle your past clients, which brings me to our last point...

<br>**4. Past clients.** Make sure you meet all of your clients’ needs and commitments throughout each transaction so they become happy past clients. As you know, happy past clients produce new leads.&nbsp;
